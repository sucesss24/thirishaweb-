    Theory & Event is a journal of political theory with an international editorial board, authors, and readership. It welcomes theoretical interventions, interpretations, and engagements with political events, institutions, cultures, and issues as they unfold. It provides a forum attractive to intellectuals who work at the intersections of political theory, cultural theory, political economy, aesthetics, philosophy, and the arts. The journal features innovative, peer-reviewed political theorizing in the humanities and the social sciences, publishing academic essays as well as other forms of writing and representation--including polemics, photography, and moving images and sounds--that engage diverse political events and phenomena throughout the world. These may include such political formations as climate, sovereignty, territory, government, nation, race, family, gender, individual, capital and the state; old, new, and emerging forms of subjectivity as they may be expressed in elections, popular uprisings, affective flows and assemblages; old, new, and combined media formations; as well as investigations into the objects and conditions of politics, ethics, and critique. The journal encourages contributions that are both rigorous and lively, and that are attentive to scholarship without sacrificing creativity or timeliness.
